Algorithms desgined to match single images does not always genrealize to work on sets of images. Even though on first signt it may seem that we can just average the predicition/probabliles from each image, that is never the optimal way. For example, let us say that we have image sets $S_1$, $S_2$ .. $S_n$. Let us use ${I^p}_{m}$ to denote $p^{th}$ image from the set $S_m$. Then
